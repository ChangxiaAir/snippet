FRAGTEST(8)                                           FRAGTEST(8)


NAME
       fragtest - test IP fragment reassembly behaviour

SYNOPSIS
       fragtest TESTS ... host

DESCRIPTION
       fragtest  probes  the  remote host to determine its TCP/IP
       stack behaviour.

       The TESTS may include any of  the  following  (or  may  be
       specified as all to perform them all):

       ping   Send an ICMP echo request to the host.

       ip-opt Send  ICMP echo requests with different IP options,
              to see which IP options are supported.

       frag   Send an ICMP echo request as 8-byte fragments.

       frag-new
              Send an ICMP echo request as 8-byte fragments  with
              an  overlapping  16-byte  fragment,  favoring newer
              data in reassembly.

       frag-old
              Send an ICMP echo request as 8-byte fragments  with
              an  overlapping  16-byte  fragment,  favoring older
              data in reassembly.

       frag-timeout
              Send an ICMP  echo  request  as  8-byte  fragments,
              omitting  the  last  fragment, and wait for an ICMP
              time-exceeded-in-reassembly reply.

BUGS
       Firewalls or other filtering network devices may block  IP
       fragments,  packets  with  IP  options, ICMP echo traffic,
       etc.

NAME
       fragroute - intercept, modify, and rewrite egress traffic

SYNOPSIS
       fragroute [-f file] host

DESCRIPTION
       fragroute  intercepts, modifies, and rewrites egress traf-
       fic destined for the specified host, implementing most  of
       the  attacks described in the Secure Networks ``Insertion,
       Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network  Intrusion
       Detection'' paper of January 1998.

       The options are as follows:

       -f file
              Read  ruleset  from  the  specified file instead of
              /usr/local/etc/fragroute.conf.

       Unlike fragrouter(8), this program  only  affects  packets
       originating  from  the local machine destined for a remote
       host.  Do not enable IP forwarding on the local machine.

RULESET
       fragroute is composed of several modules which enable var-
       ious  configuration directives. Each directive operates on
       a logical packet queue handed to it by the previous  rule.

       # string ...
              Ruleset comment, no-op.

       delay first|last|random ms
              Delay  the  delivery  of the first, last, or a ran-
              domly selected packet from the  queue  by  ms  mil-
              liseconds.

       drop first|last|random prob-%
              Drop the first, last, or a randomly selected packet
              from the queue with a probability  of  prob-%  per-
              cent.

       dup first|last|random prob-%
              Duplicate  the  first, last, or a randomly selected
              packet from the queue with a probability of  prob-%
              percent.

       echo string ...
              Echo the string argument(s) to standard output.

       ip_chaff dup|opt|ttl
              Interleave  IP  packets in the queue with duplicate
              IP packets containing  different  payloads,  either
              scheduled  for  later delivery, carrying invalid IP
              options, or bearing short time-to-live values.



                                                                1





FRAGROUTE(8)                                         FRAGROUTE(8)


       ip_frag size [old|new]
              Fragment each packet in the queue into size-byte IP
              fragments, preserving the complete transport header
              in the first fragment.  Optional  fragment  overlap
              may  be  specified as old or new, to favor newer or
              older data.

       ip_opt lsrr|ssrr ptr ip-addr ...
              Add IP options to every packet, to enable loose  or
              strict  source  routing. The route should be speci-
              fied as  list  of  IP  addresses,  and  a  bytewise
              pointer  into  them  (e.g. the minimum ptr value is
              4).

       ip_ttl ttl
              Set the IP time-to-live value of  every  packet  to
              ttl.

       ip_tos tos
              Set the IP type-of-service bits for every packet to
              tos.

       order random|reverse
              Re-order the packets in the queue randomly,  or  in
              reverse.

       print  Print  each  packet  in  the queue in tcpdump-style
              format.

       tcp_chaff cksum|null|paws|rexmit|seq|syn|ttl
              Interleave TCP segments in the queue with duplicate
              TCP  segments containing different payloads, either
              bearing invalid TCP  checksums,  null  TCP  control
              flags,  older TCP timestamp options for PAWS elimi-
              nation,  faked  retransmits  scheduled  for   later
              delivery,  out-of-window sequence numbers, requests
              to re-synchronize sequence numbers  mid-stream,  or
              short time-to-live values.

       tcp_opt mss|wscale size
              Add  TCP  options  to  every TCP packet, to set the
              maximum segment size or window scaling factor.

       tcp_seg size [old|new]
              Segment each TCP data segment  in  the  queue  into
              size-byte  TCP  segments.  Optional segment overlap
              may be specified as old or new, to favor  newer  or
              older data.

EXAMPLES
       Fragment  all traffic to a Windows host into forward-over-
       lapping 8-byte fragments (favoring  older  data),  reorder
       randomly, and print to standard output:




                                                                2

            ip_frag 8 old
            order random
            print

       Segment  all  TCP  data to a host into forward-overlapping
       4-byte segments (favoring  newer  data),  interleave  with
       overwriting, random chaff segments bearing older timestamp
       options for PAWS elimination, reorder randomly, and  print
       to standard output:

            tcp_seg 4 new
            tcp_chaff paws
            order random
            print

BUGS
       It is entirely possible to mangle your outgoing traffic so
       badly that no remote TCP/IP stack will accept it. K.I.S.S.
